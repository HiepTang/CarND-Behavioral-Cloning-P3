#**Behavior Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Files Submitted and Code Quality
### Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode
My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to load, preprocess data and create, train the model
* drive.py for driving car in autonomous mode - increased the desired speed to 30 mph
* model.h5 contains a trained neural network model
* writeup_report.md summaries the result
